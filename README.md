# robotmodel
this repository contains two designs of the robot the first file contains the original design and the second file contain the new base design. 

## Brilliant Bojo-Habbi.stl
this fail contains the original design with changes that i see it's better for the design.

### changes I made: 
- i put the screen inside the frame ( the robot body) not in front of it this will make the design more better as the robot hold the screen
this is the only change that I made and it look more better from my point of view.

## new base design.stl
this file contains the new base design.

### changes I made:
- Modified the shape of the base so it look more modern and fit with the robot design.

- I modified the base of the frame to fit on the new base of the robot.
